# Devils-Invent-November-2017

The Universal Serial Blaster (USB) is a gun-shaped controller for the casual gamer. I was part of a team, "The Team that Spent Forty Minutes Picking this Name", which designed the USB during the November Devils Invent: Fantasy and Fiction Event held from November 17-19, 2017 at ASU Tempe, where we placed first. 

Designed primarily for First Person Shooter (FPS) games but compatible even with Third Person Shooter games, the controller possessed buttons that performed ‘reload’, ‘trigger’ functions and a ‘special function’ button. Two foot pads – one to move the character and one to ‘jump’ – accompanied the gun.  

Programmed using an Arduino Board and the Arduino programming language, the controller substituted simple and intuitive button clicks for (often complex) keyboard and mouse commands. It worked with PC games and is even compatible with Xbox and PlayStation.

My role on the team had me programming some of the buttons and LEDs, minor circuitry, designing and wiring the footpads, and making the presentation.
Alexander Vermillion worked on most of the logic and the code, making the body of the gun, wiring the various buttons, and connecting all the components. 
Rahulrajan Karthikeyan worked on parts of the coding aspect and the presentation. Tarun Anandanpillai contributed to the presentation and carpentry. 

"The Team that Spent Forty Minutes Picking this Name" was later renamed to "Rendering Bullets" and constitutes myself, Alexander Vermillion, Rahulrajan Karthikeyan, and Tarun Anandanpillai.
